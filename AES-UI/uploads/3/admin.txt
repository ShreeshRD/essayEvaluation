In a small saucepan, add finely chopped dark chocolate and a splash of cocoa powder. Stir occasionally until melted. While waiting for that to melt, mix together cornstarch with a small splash of whole milk.  Once chocolate is melted, add the rest of your milk slowly while constantly whisking. Continue to heat until all of it is nice and hot. Then whisk in the cornstarch slurry. Continue to heat until thickened. Pour into a mug, topped with whipped cream and dust with cocoa powder.
