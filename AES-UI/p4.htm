Minfong Ho</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have
moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her
driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to
see if the plant can be purchased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>It was like walking into another world. A
hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of
tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly
random profusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is
that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon
sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to
reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded
their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And
sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the
well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom
floating in the bucket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle
toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias,
and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized
she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out
and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet
toward the center—just as she had known it would feel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>And beside it was yet another old friend, a
small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white
centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to see it in a
pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in
brick walls or between tiled roofs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar,
too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with
exquisite little white blossoms on it.  “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the
feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on
its tag, “jasmine.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>One of the blossoms had fallen off, and
carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed
in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost
feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as
she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had
dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun,
then slip a dok Malik bud into it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand
now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight.
That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The
hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>A wave of loss so deep and strong that it
stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride
into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>And in the warm moist shelter of the
greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>It was already dusk when Saeng reached home.
The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the
chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if
oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden,
digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng
until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma
laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully. “Goodness, it’s past five. What
took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed the potted plant
that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of
surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where did you get it?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her
mother’s next question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“How much?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>For answer Saeng handed her mother some
coins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled,
“Oh, but I forgot! You and the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“Then what else—?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars
for it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“You what?” Her mother stared at her
incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden
didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed the
tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“What happened?” she asked, more gently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said
nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at
the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Her mother reached out and brushed the
fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok
faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She
found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst
into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen
this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s
strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball
of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. “Look how
root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>She went over to the corner of the vegetable
patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and
she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed
out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes.
There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered,
getting up and taking the shovel away from her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll
bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would
you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>“I’d love it,” Saeng said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a
hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it. She could hear the
sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the
sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and
Saeng’s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of
her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter
melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating
it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now,
and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese
flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng now. Almost
reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as
strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season,
almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as
their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the
distance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to
herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this
hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.</span></p>
