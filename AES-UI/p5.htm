<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>My parents, originally from
Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room
apartment I would soon call home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>In 1961, I was born into
this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents
created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My
parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich
culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for
which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this
day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence
of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations
that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Growing up in this
environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of
mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was
the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood,
despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great
solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking
immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own
kind, were clearly in need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Our landlord and his
daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria
graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were
Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement
apartment. (I would not know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and
Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and
Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and
regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family members came and
went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were
able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their
door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do
the same for us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>My mother and father had
come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language
or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their
children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families,
friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally
and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their
native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were strong
and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find
the kind of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a
laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United
States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they
could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to
better times drove them to endure these hard times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>I will always be grateful to
my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what they
did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often
told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve
thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my
gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age
and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives,
and these teachings have been the basis of my life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>It was in this simple house
that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this
country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the
kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast)
always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was
here where I learned the real definition of “family.” And for this, I will
never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this
simple house into a home.</span></p>
