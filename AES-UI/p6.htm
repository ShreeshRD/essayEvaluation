font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>When the Empire State
Building was conceived, it was planned as the world’s tallest building, taller
even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second
Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the
tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was
determined to outstrip it in height.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The architect building the
Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed
a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media
by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height
of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the
Empire State Building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Al Smith realized that he
was close to losing the title of world’s tallest building, and on December 11,
1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250
feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more
distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the
plan:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The
top of the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a
spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of
the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they
said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped
for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>This dream of the aviation
pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building
was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships,
which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and
new routes that were yet to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:center'><b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The
Age of Dirigibles</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>By the 1920s, dirigibles
were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as
blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes
of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air.
Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and
rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment,
under the balloon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Dirigibles had a top speed
of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for
thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand
feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to
their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al
Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to
the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several
hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles
were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the
front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could
swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible
by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The architects and engineers
of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the
equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst,
New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of
dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los
Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the
president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer
dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>When asked about the mooring
mast, Al Smith commented:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>It’s
on the level, all right. No kidding. We’re working on the thing now. One set of
engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable
arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe
way of mooring airships to this mast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:center'><b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Designing
the Mast</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The architects could not
simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building’s flat roof. A
thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single
cable tether, would add stress to the building’s frame. The stress of the
dirigible’s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way
to the building’s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The
steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and
strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars’
worth of modifications had to be made to the building’s framework.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Rather than building a
utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny
glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from
inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the
building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners,
of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the
mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would
be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and
stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and
ticket areas would be located.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The building would now be
102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open
observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as
the boarding area for dirigible passengers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Once the architects had
designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the
building’s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had
been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing
for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel
and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the
workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an
American flag again—this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0cm;text-align:center'><b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The
Fate of the Mast</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The mooring mast of the
Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons
that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest
reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States
used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the
German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on
May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse
that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated
area such as downtown New York.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The greatest obstacle to the
successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the
building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the
dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel
around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields
could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the
Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on
the street, was neither practical nor safe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The other practical reason
why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law
against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it
illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,
although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire
idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles
approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of
forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp
spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible’s
shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Two weeks later, another
dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it
would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building.
Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a
worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope
dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after
this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931,
Irving Clavan of the building’s architectural office said, “The as yet unsolved
problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it
desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing
gear.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>By the late 1930s, the idea
of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly
disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future,
had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had
been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made
over into the world’s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the
sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation
deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.</span></p>
