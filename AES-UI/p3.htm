<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT
NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo
cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.”
It’s not that a group of old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes
wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>At a reservoir campground
outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening
and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done
was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I
followed their advice and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that
was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>They’d sounded so sure of
themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to
along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived
at the first “town.” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one
time—say, before the last world war—but on that morning it fit the traditional
definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on.
The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and
rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Twenty miles up the road, I
came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral
that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I
had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through
the high deserts of California in June.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>I got down on my hands and
knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A
tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in
the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several
minutes, but the water wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a
drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The old guys had sworn the
next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would
conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Not two miles into this next
section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by
short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large
highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED
SPEED LIMIT.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The speed limit was 55 mph.
I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>I toiled on. At some point,
tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look
like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>The water bottles contained
only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and
the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in
June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their
porch in decades, caused me to laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>It was a sad, hopeless
laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I
began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling
myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fi ne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Over one long, crippling
hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it
wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my
last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>In an ironic twist that
should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years earlier,
by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his
mouth could still be seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>I hung my head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>That smoky blues tune
“Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>I got back on the bike, but
not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read
once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what
spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in
my throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>It didn’t really matter. I
was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive
outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their
wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that
paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>Somehow, I climbed away from
the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while
losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear
were all behind me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>GARY AND WILBER’S FISH
CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE YOUR BEST BET!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>“And the only bet,” I
remember thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>As I stumbled into a rather
modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to
seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even though I
didn’t own a rod or reel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>An old guy sitting in a
chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head
as I slumped against the wall beside him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>“Where you headed in such a
hurry?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>“Yosemite,” I whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>“Know the best way to get
there?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>I watched him from the
corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group I’d
listened to in Lodi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>“Yes, sir! I own a very good
map.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:15.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Avenir Next LT Pro Light",sans-serif'>And I promised myself right
then that I’d always stick to it in the future.</span></p>
