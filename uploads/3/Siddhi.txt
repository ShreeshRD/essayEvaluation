The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” this shows that he had no energy left.
