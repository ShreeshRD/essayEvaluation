@CAPS1 @CAPS1 my cell phone buzzes in my pocket. Lexa, @CAPS2. I don't know if I can ever get over the fight that we had yesterday after she called me some names. I actually answered once and said, I need sometime @CAPS5 be patient. She definetly isn't listening. So, I decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring.@CAPS3, Are you there?" she sounds desperate to call  me the nickname she always has ''yes''  ''I'm sososososorry, I didn't mean it''. ''I told you I needed time and for you to be patient.'' I say almost in tears. ''I know but I can't be when I @CAPS5 hurt my best friend''. ''Patience means that you are understanding & tolerant about waiting without complain''. ''@CAPS4''.  ''@CAPS5 try to be patient and @MONTH1 be you wouldn't be complaining''.  ''@CAPS6'' she saysl then hangs up. Sure I think I am so mad that she thinks she can @CAPS5 can and it would be all better. She should've waited. I fonly she'd been patient."
